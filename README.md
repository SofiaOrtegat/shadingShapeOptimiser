The primary methodologies and schema are outlined in **Note.pdf** within the *Note* folder.

Sample outcomes are provided on the **wiki** page. 

The crux of the algorithm is inspired by Tai-Pang Wu and Chi-Keung Tang's work **Dense Photometric Stereo Using a Mirror Sphere and Graph Cut**, available in the *IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (2005).
